# COVID-19 Analyzer

## Purpose

The Shiny App can analyze the changes in COVID-19 cases and deaths by country from January 22nd, 2020, to November 4th, 2021, and analyze the number of vaccinations by country from February 22nd, 2021, to November 4th, 2021. Secondly, this Shiny App can also compare the differences in the number of cases, deaths and vaccinations among countries. Thirdly, this Shiny App can show the heath care and poverty condition for each country. By knowing each country's heath care and poverty condition, we can find certain reasons that some countries have large number of cases and deaths or some countries don't have large number of cases and deaths.

## How to use it

* Tab 1 shows the global COVID-19 situation. Tab1 has two little tabs. First little tab is a map, users can choose a type and a date that they want to know from the left sidebar. The type includes cases, deaths and vaccinations. Then, the main page will show the global map with the information that users have chose. In addition, the second little tab shows the line plots about global or continents' cases or deaths. The users can choose a level which includes global and continent and can choose a type which includes cases and deaths in the left sidebar. Then, the main page will show a line plot. 

* Tab 2 shows information on the epidemic in a single country. First, the user can view the cumulative distribution of the data line plot. In the left screen, users can select countries to be observed, types of observations (cases, deaths, vaccinations), and whether logarithmic transformation of data is required. Second, users can also view daily histogram additions of data. Similarly, on the left side of the screen, users can select the country they want to look at, the type (cases, deaths) they want to look at and adjust the width of the histogram. 

* Tab 3 shows information on the epidemic in multiple countries. First, the user can view the cumulative distribution of the data line plot. In the left screen, users can select many countries to be observed, types of observations (cases, Deaths, vaccinations), and whether logarithmic transformation of data is required. Second, users can also view daily histogram additions of data in multiple countries. Similarly, on the left side of the screen, users can select the country they want to look at, the type (cases, deaths) they want to look at and adjust the width of the histogram. 

* Tab 4 helps users to explore whether Healthcare and Headcount would affect vaccination in each country. By selecting the country users care about in the left box, they can view the line plot of the variation of health expenditure(% of GDP), health expenditure in public, and health expenditure per Capita in these countries from 2004 to 2014. And the line plot of how HeadCount has changed from 2004 to 2019. In addition, users can also enter the year of interest to see the country's rank table in these aspects. A headcount table showed that a high percentage of families are thought to have incomes below the poverty line in several countries.
